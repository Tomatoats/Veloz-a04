    //I'm so sorry. I'll get it done after the due date
    //Also lots of sonarlint warnings because its not done
    //If I can get the info in i'd be set, i essentially did
    //inventoryManager as if I had the info i have the gist of
    //what I need to do and if this was just a .txt instead of JSON
    //I feel very confident I would've had it down
