     /*So for this one we're gonna take in a .json file and read
     in the file using Gson parser. Then we'll take in the
     name, price, and quantity, then in the next class we're gonna use a scanner
     in which it asks for user for the product name. If the product ddoesn't
     exist, it tells us to ask again. Once they find a product name, print out
     name, price, and quantity
